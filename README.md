Code Review Summary

Good aspects:
- Clean separation between ReadOnly and Editable modes
- Proper TypeScript types
- Good use of shadcn/ui components
- Immutable state updates in model functions
- Proper form handling with onSubmit
- Accessibility considerations (aria-labels, proper form structure)

Issues & Suggestions:

1. Typo in filename

EditableCkeckList.tsx should be EditableChecklist.tsx (app/page.tsx:10)

2. Missing persistence (as you noted)

Add localStorage/sessionStorage:
// In app/page.tsx, replace initial state with:
const [checkList, setCheckList] = useState<CheckList>(() => {
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('checklist');
    if (saved) return JSON.parse(saved);
}
return { id: crypto.randomUUID(), title: "My Checklist", items: [] };
});

// Add useEffect for persistence:
useEffect(() => {
localStorage.setItem('checklist', JSON.stringify(checkList));
}, [checkList]);

3. Edge cases missed:

- Empty title handling: Title can be cleared completely
- XSS protection: No HTML sanitization for user input
- UUID collision: Low probability but crypto.randomUUID() could theoretically collide
- Memory leaks: No cleanup in useEffect
- Hydration mismatch: SSR vs client localStorage mismatch

4. UX improvements:

- No keyboard navigation for delete buttons
- No undo functionality
- No item reordering
- No bulk operations (delete all completed)
- No item editing after creation

5. Performance:

- Re-renders entire list on any change
- Consider useCallback for handlers passed to children

6. Accessibility:

- Missing focus management when switching modes
- No skip links for keyboard users
- Could benefit from ARIA live regions for dynamic updates

Priority fixes: filename typo, persistence, title validation, and hydration handling.
